Vision Statement:  
Establish a dynamic scheduling Android application that provides help with a college studentâ€™s complex schedule in order to more efficiently accomplish their academic goals.  The primary goal is to assist the user in working their academic projects, homeworks, and other education related tasks around their busy schedule based on the estimated duration of daily study time.

Functional Overview:

1. The system will be an Android app.

2. The system will allow a student to schedule study times on a local database calendar.

3. The system will have an alarm in place to remind the students of approaching appointments based on local db calendar. 

4a. The user will be able to assign study windows to the local db calendar (i.e. 5pm - 9pm MWF, 10am-2pm SSu)
4b. The system will allow a student to enter an assignment, its due date and required number of hours. 
4c. Once an assignment is entered, the system will schedule available work times for that assignment on the calendar.
4d. The system will adjust the schedule to fit within the study windows and avoid other scheduled events.
4e. The system will not schedule study times in slots too small for use (i.e. 15 min or less)

5a. The system will provide a suggested period of time to completion based on project type (this will require research)
5b. Students will be able to assign specific estimated times to projects manually.

6a. The system will require the student to check in and out of any study or work sessions. 
6b. If a time is missed the system will recalculate and reschedule based on remaining time to completion.

Wish List:

1. The system will sync with their gmail calendar.
2. Reports will be generated that show success rates of scheduled times vs missed or cancelled.
3. Sync with other instances of the application across multiple devices for larger multiperson projects
